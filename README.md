# Future-Poll-Dashboard
This repo showcases the future poll dashboard my team and I developed during my senior year of college (2020). The dashboard was built using HTML/CSS, React js, and mutliple APIs. The purpose of this project was to develop a one-stop-shop where investors and others with similar interests can view multiple sources of information about events during the unpredictable times of Covid and the 2020 presidential election.

## Functions
 * The main scroll bar under US map represents a relative timeline from the beginning of the election (left end) to the ending of the election (right end)
 * Displays dynamic United States map that reacts to main scroll bar. Displays which party each state voted for and the total votes for each candidate at any given time
 * Displays multiple news articles, twitter posts, and stock data that change together via the main scroll bar
 * News and Twitter containers hold plentiful amounts of information and can be individually scrolled to view all content.
 * Individual news elements can redirect user to the source website upon clicking on it
